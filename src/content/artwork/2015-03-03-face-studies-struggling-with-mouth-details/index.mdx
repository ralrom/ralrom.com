<p>Productive day but I don&rsquo;t think I got much out of it; my practice is too general. I need to find my biggest problem and focus on it until I get it right. If I think back, I realize I didn&rsquo;t know how to handle the mouth properly for any of these so I&rsquo;ll work on that tomorrow</p>
