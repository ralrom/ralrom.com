## Phone

My phone has probably been the worst influence on my mental health ever since I've had one. I've gotten addicted to notifications, whether it's a message from friends or love interests, likes on social media, replies on forums, etc. It has really taken away from my ability to be present. I use my phone all the time:

- When I go to sleep
- When I wake up
- In the bathroom
- In the elevator
- The second I'm bored
- When I put it face down on the table and pick it back up 30s later

    - Never turn off the downtime feature on the phone again
    - Keep AppBlock in strict mode - limit social media & YouTube to scheduled time
    - Keep the phone away from me (in my bag when at work, at the entrance when at home)

## Piano

I have been slowly progressing at the Piano but I am also my own worst enemy when it comes to making progress due to the following bad habits:

- Playing the same piece over & over on Synthesia
- Not learning how to read sheet music
- Avoiding the music courses & books I bought

<div className="px-4 py-[1px] bg-green-200 dark:bg-green-400 dark:text-black rounded">
    - Commit to schedule to go through the courses & books
    - Uninstall Synthesia
    - Take private lessons again
</div>

## Art

I regularly feel guilty about not working on my art. It's important to me and I've always come back to wanting to create things. I think I have potential and I'd be much more fulfilled if I created more often.

- Not working on the figurines I've started painting
- Not scheduling time to create art
- Feeling the need to post everything on social media
- Always copying art, never drawing from imagination
- Not studying the anatomy books I bought

<div className="px-4 py-[1px] bg-green-200 dark:bg-green-400 dark:text-black rounded">
    - Commit to schedule
      - Regularly work on figurines
      - Regularly go through anatomy books
    - Keep some time at the end of each drawing session to draw from imagination
</div>

## Health

I want to feel better in my body: a bit more muscle and a better posture/more flexibility. I am also chronically under sleeping.

- Telling myself I'm too tired to go to the gym
- Skipping the run club I started
- Not getting treated for the shoulder pain I've had for years now
- Sliding into my chair at the computer
- Skipping my tractions/posture exercises
- Skipping my exercises & stretches at lunch time
- Not journaling regularly

<div className="px-4 py-[1px] bg-green-200 dark:bg-green-400 dark:text-black rounded">
    - Commit to schedule
      - Gym
      - Lunchtime exercises & stretches
      - Tractions + exercises during morning routine
    - Focus on hitting bedtime
    - Prepare my running bag on Tuesday night
    - Book shoulder appointment at Biron - I already have the doctor's referal
</div>

## Proposed schedule

My proposed schedule is built around having 2 hours of guilt free leasure from 7pm to 9pm. Every thing else is accounted for. Even with 2 hours of free time, I can still accomplish a lot if I stick to the rest. My hope is to keep tweaking this schedule as I adjust to it. The schedule is pretty much the same every day of the week for now:
