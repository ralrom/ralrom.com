title: Designing the Lucky Gorilla Brochure
summary: The story of winning my first design contest by creating a brochure for Lucky Gorilla IT services. After six rejected attempts and valuable feedback, I persevered by reorganizing content, testing different orientations and icons, and ultimately delivering a design that felt warm and inviting rather than cold and corporate.

I've been completing the ["Learn Photoshop, Web Design & Profitable Freelancing"](https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-make-money-with-photoshop/) online course at Udemy. The classes walk you through creating designs in Photoshop and earning money in design contests.

After completing the course, I searched for contests on [hatchwise](http://www.hatchwise.com) where I found a brochure design contest with very few entries from other designers and a good winning prize.

## The Design Brief

[Lucky Gorilla](http://www.luckygorilla.com) provides IT services for homes and small businesses. The contest holder wanted an 8.5x11&Prime; flyer that could be posted in local shops and sent in mailings.

The only directives were to use the company logo colors &ndash; black & blue &ndash; and to include the following text on the brochure:

> **Business Managed IT Services**
>
> - On-call residential or small business IT support
> - Unlimited end-user support 24/7/365
> - Installation and Support of Cloud and/or on-premise servers
> - [10 more points… &ndash; removed for brevity]
>
> **With The IT Company as your partner in IT, you will:**
>
> - Enjoy greater productivity &ndash; less downtime means more work time
> - Concentrate on your core business &ndash; while we take care of your technology 24×7
> - Maximize your return on IT investment &ndash; strategic technology can open up new doors
> - [3 more points… &ndash; removed for brevity]

## How I tackled it

The text was too long and unorganized; people who were handed this brochure wouldn't bother reading this _wall of text_ so I restructured the content under separate categories &ndash; each with a unique icon.

### Tri-Fold Brochure

My initial design was a tri-fold brochure which the contest holder eliminated; however, he gave feedback asking me to align the paragraphs.

### Left-Aligned Paragraphs

This time, I went with left-aligned paragraphs and I added a background image. Although he liked the style of my brochure,
he rated this design 2-stars and said he did not want a landscape orientation.

Afterwards, he published a new design brief in which he reorganized his content in a similar way to what I had been doing. This was my cue to keep pushing; we both agreed on the layout. At the same time, I felt I had lost my uniqueness over the competition.

### Portrait Orientation

In this entry, I kept the same style but switched to a portrait orientation &ndash; this one was eliminated without feedback.

### New Icons

I went with new icons to stand out from the other designs. Once again this entry was eliminated without feedback.

At this point, I knew something was wrong &ndash; my entries were being eliminated without feedback so I took a step back and made a list of the weaknesses in my design:

- There is **no introduction**; I have no idea at a glance who Lucky Gorilla is or what it does. It **feels cold** and **boring**.
- The background image is barely visible and it makes the text less readable.
- I do not like the top bar &ndash; the logo is sticking out and the text feels unbalanced.

### Seventh Try Is the Charm

This is the design which won me the contest. I looked at other brochures for inspiration before starting this one and I had my list of all the things I wanted to change. Making that list really helped me produce something I liked.

I am delighted with the way this brochure turned out and with the progress I made with the design. This was also my first contest win and I earned it by persevering knowing I had a good idea. So cheers to me!
