title: An Avid Reader Makes a Better Developer
---

When I first began coding, I felt documentation was boring.
I used to dive right into coding. As a result, I spent countless hours troubleshooting and writing unmaintainable code.

Since then, I've learned to strive for better code. A big part of my improvement is reading documentation, best-practices and blog posts. It can be tedious, but having in-depth knowledge of how your tools work is important for writing good code.

I remember being so excited on my first project that I began coding right away. I followed a few tutorials and jumbled the code together to get my app running as soon as possible. Deep into the project, I realized that my code had become too difficult too maintain. Rewriting everything from scratch would have been easier than adding new features.

When I became interested in front-end development, I learned that I should minify JavaScript and CSS files, but tools like Grunt seemed too complicated to learn. So I used to upload my files to online minifiers and paste them back into the file where they belonged. When I finally read the Grunt documentation and learned how to use it, I was overfilled with relief for never having to go through that manual minification process again.

Finally, last year, I wrote a small web-application in JavaScript with hundreds of lines for DOM manipulation. After spending hours on essentially re-inventing the wheel, I discovered libraries like AngularJS many months after completing the application.

After making all these mistakes, I now devote a significant part of my development time on researching best practices and planning my projects. In exchange for my time, I learn how to structure and manage my code, how to use tools to avoid monotonous activities such as JavaScript and CSS minification, and how to use libraries that provide the functionality I need so that I can focus on adding cool features to my applications. Ultimately, the time I spend reading is multiplied many times over in time saved while coding, and it helps me grow as a developer.
