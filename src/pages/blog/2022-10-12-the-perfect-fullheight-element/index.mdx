title: The Perfect Full-Height Element

Creating full-height HTML elements isn't as easy as it might seem. The main challenge is the way mobile browsers handle viewport units. The ideal scenario would be to set an element's height to `100vh` and be done with it. That works on desktop, but on mobile, browsers hide their toolbars on scroll and change their viewport size. So browsers have a decision to make here: should `100vh` include the height of the toolbars or not? I'd like `100vh` to exclude the toolbars because it's the value I use when I don't want elements to be cut off at the bottom. However, the Webkit team decided that `100vh` would represent the larger viewport size:

> This is completely intentional. It took quite a bit of work on our part to achieve this effect. :)
>
> The base problem is this: the visible area changes dynamically as you scroll. If we update the CSS viewport height accordingly, we need to update the layout during the scroll. Not only that looks like shit, but doing that at 60 FPS is practically impossible in most pages (60 FPS is the baseline framerate on iOS).
> It is hard to show you the "looks like shit" part, but imagine as you scroll, the contents moves and what you want on screen is continuously shifting.
>
> Dynamically updating the height was not working, we had a few choices: drop viewport units on iOS, match the document size like before iOS 8, use the small view size, use the large view size.
>
> From the data we had, using the larger view size was the best compromise. Most website using viewport units were looking great most of the time.

This is what it looks like on an iPhone 13 Pro, there's a `100vh` element with text positioned at its bottom. When the toolbar is visible, it covers the text:

<video class="max-h-[70vh] bg-primary-900 p-2 mx-auto rounded-lg" src={vid_100vh} autoplay playsinline muted loop />

## What solutions are already out there?

I'll start with the prior art, these are solutions that can work but they all have flaws which is why I'm sharing my technique.

### Setting the height to `100%`

For simple layouts, you can set the height to `100%` from the `html` element all the way down to the element that should fill the screen. This works on all browsers but I wouldn't use it for anything but the simplest web page. The main reason is that passing height `100%` all the way down to your element is not flexible and can cause other layout issues.

While passing height `100%` is a pure CSS solution, it's not an ideal one for the web apps I tend to build.

### Using the new viewport units &ndash; large, small, and dynamic

> Viewport units similar to vw and vh that are based on shown or hidden browser UI states to address shortcomings of the original units. Currently defined as the lvh, lvw, svh, svw, dvh, dvw units.

This will eventually be the correct solution; however, right now, [browser support is terrible](https://caniuse.com/viewport-unit-variants). At the time of writing this article, Oct. 2022, I don't recommend using these units.

### Using `window.innerHeight`

Unfortunately, CSS has failed us. It's time to pull out the big guns with JavaScript. Most solutions I have found on this subject rely on `window.innerHeight` and `window.addEventListener('resize', ...)`. It's a good solution, but it has a little flaw if used by itself. Whenever the toolbar disappears or reappears, the `window.innerHeight` value changes and causes an abrupt page jump when the height adjusts itself.

Take a look:

<video
  class="max-h-[70vh] bg-primary-900 p-2 mx-auto rounded-lg"
  src={vid_innerHeight}
  autoplay
  playsinline
  muted
  loop
/>

### Improving `window.innerHeight`

We want to use `window.innerHeight` without the jump that it causes when toolbars resize the viewport. We can't just ignore resize events because they're important for screen rotation or window resizes on desktop. There is a solution. It lies in the fact that `100vh` remains constant despite the browser UI changing. We can use that to detect actual page resizes and ignore ones caused by a toolbar resize.

First, we need an element in our HTML that will serve as a measuring stick. It can be placed anywhere in the DOM:

```css
#measuring-stick {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  top: 0;
  left: -1px;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

Next, we'll use the measuring stick element to detect if the browser height has actually changed or not. We know that `100vh` stays constant when the toolbar resizes, so, on a resize event, we can check if the measuringStick's height changed. It it stayed the same, we know the window resize event was triggered by the toolbar and we can ignore it. Otherwise, we have to actually recalculate our height. Here I'm using a technique that sets a CSS variable named `--vh`, but you could also adapt this script and directly set your element's height to `window.innerHeight`. You may also want to throttle the resize handler event which I won't cover in this article.

```js
// Reference value
let browserHeight_previousValue = null;

const setVh = () => {
  const measuringStickHeight = document.querySelector("#measuring-stick").clientHeight;
  const browserHeight_hasChanged = measuringStickHeight !== browserHeight_previousValue;

  // Quit if the measuringStick's height didn't change
  if (!browserHeight_hasChanged) return;

  // Set our CSS variable
  document.querySelector(":root").style.setProperty("--vh", window.innerHeight / 100 + "px");

  // Update our reference value
  browserHeight_previousValue = measuringStickHeight;
};

window.addEventListener("resize", setVh);
window.addEventListener("load", setVh);
```

Finally we can set the height on our full-height elements like this:

```html
<div style="height: calc(100 * var(--vh);"></div>
```

Here's the final result, notice how it's smooth and there are no jumps when the toolbar hides or appears:

<video
  class="max-h-[70vh] bg-primary-900 p-2 mx-auto rounded-lg"
  src={vid_measuringStick}
  autoplay
  playsinline
  muted
  loop
/>

As a bonus because I'm feeling generous, here it is as a React hook:

```jsx
import { useLayoutEffect, useRef } from "react";

const use_setVh = () => {
  const browserHeight_previousValue = useRef(null);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const setVh = () => {
      const measuringStickHeight = document.querySelector("#measuring-stick").clientHeight;
      const browserHeight_hasChanged = measuringStickHeight !== browserHeight_previousValue.current;

      if (browserHeight_hasChanged) {
        browserHeight_previousValue.current = measuringStickHeight;
        document.querySelector(":root").style.setProperty("--vh", window.innerHeight / 100 + "px");
      }
    };

    window.addEventListener("resize", setVh);
    setVh();

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("resize", setVh);
    };
  }, []);
};

export default use_setVh;
```

As mentionned before, you may want to throttle the resize handler event. I hope you found this useful!
