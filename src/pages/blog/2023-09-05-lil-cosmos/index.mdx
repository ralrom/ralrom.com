## Intro

Each summer our company organizes a large one-night camping event. It's like a private festival; there are 3 stages, live artists, fireworks, secret bars and more. My friends & I wanted to pull off a secret stunt this year and so we created our own miniature stage.

We even made an original music album with 9 songs for the stunt. Everyone who saw the stage loved it and we're very happy with the reactions.

## Final result

    Each song has its own visuals (screen on the back & on the sides) as well as custom lighting, all of which is driven
    by TouchDesigner. The dance moves you see are all motion captured from our friends who voluntereed to dance for Lil
    Cosmos.

## The Making Of

In our design we wanted 4 screens: one on each side of the stage, one behind the stage and one as the floor of stage to create the Pepper's ghost effect. Our intention was to 3D print the stage truss and the UFO, and add a few lasers around the front of the stage that would be controlled by TouchDesigner to react to the music.

    In the orignal design we had 42 middle male pieces; in the final version we reduced it to 30. All the other piece
    counts are accurate.

Originally we wanted to glue the columns to the truss on site to make it easier to transport. However, it turned out
that the trusses were more fragile than anticipated and the expoy took a long time to fully cure. For both of those
reasons, we decided to do the full assembly in advance at the cost of making it more difficult to fit in a car.
